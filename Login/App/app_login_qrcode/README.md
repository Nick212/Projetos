## Project Details ##

This sample is part of the Intel® XDK. 
Download the Intel® XDK at [http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5](http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5). This sample application demonstrates how to scan a barcode using the [Phonegap* Barcode Scanner plugin](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner) to retrieve Universal Product Code (UPC) that can be used for product lookup in any UPC database like [http://www.upcdatabase.com/](http://www.upcdatabase.com/). The plugin also supports other barcode types such as QR_CODE, DATA_MATRIX and AZTEC among many others.

## NOTE: ##

Please ignore the `config.xml` file, the Cordova CLI `config.xml` format has
been changing significantly, especially with the release of CLI 5.0, and this
`config.xml` file has not been updated to reflect those changes. It will not
work as written. It was originally created for use with PhoneGap CLI and has
not been updated for use with the current PhoneGap CLI system, either.
